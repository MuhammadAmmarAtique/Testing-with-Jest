# Testing-with-Jest

This project is a basic learning and practice setup for **Jest** — a JavaScript testing framework used for unit testing.

## 📌 What I Learned

* ✅ What Jest is and how to install it as a **dev dependency**
* 🧪 **Unit testing** — testing individual pieces of code (like functions) to make sure they work correctly
* 🧠 Jest syntax:

  ```javascript
  test('description', testFunction);
  ```
* 🧮 Different **matchers** to check values and behavior (e.g. `toBe`, `toEqual`, `toHaveBeenCalled`)
* ⏳ Testing **asynchronous code** (callbacks, promises, and `async/await`)
* 🕵️ **Mock functions** and **spies** to track and control function calls during tests

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test
```

## 📁 Project Purpose

This repository is meant for learning and practicing testing concepts with Jest — building a strong foundation for writing reliable, maintainable JavaScript code.
